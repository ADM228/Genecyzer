# Genecyzer

## A tracker based on the [SNESFM](https://github.com/ADM228/SNES-FM) sound driver

Written in C++ with the [SFML framework](https://sfml-dev.org), it is (theoretically lmao) available on Windows, MacOS and Linux.  

### Features

- None  
  
### TODO

- Instruments, supporting both samples and SNES hardware noise
- Ability to make samples using modular synthesis
- Compatibility with the native version of the tracker, including the ability to open/save .srm files
- Songs, patterns, all that jazz
- SPC export, including extended ID666 tagging
- ROM export with several visualization options
- Binary song data export to use with the sound driver in your game
